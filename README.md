ReLearning
==========

This repo is a disparate collection of code covering a bunch of topics I wanted to refresh my memory on because I hadn't had cause to write such things in over ten years.

So, I am slowly working through reimplementing...

- bash scripting
- Make, Jam, Maven, etc.
- Various sorting algorithms
- Hash functions and maps
- Graph structures and traversal
- Tree Structures and traversal

I started writing them in C but I am also considering writing different languages versions of each. Likely C, Obj-C, Java and maybe i'll use this as an opportunity to finally learn Haskell.

Interview Questions
-------------------

I have been asking certain interview questions to prospective employees for years and I realized recently that I have never written the code myself that I am asking them to write for me.

So I plan to write the code to all the interview questions I have asked

- Find a loop in a singly linked list (I have asked this one hundreds of times)
- Write a basic control algorithm for an elevator
- Write a multiply operation without using the CPU multiply instruction
